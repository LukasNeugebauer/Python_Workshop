# Introduction to scientific Python for MATLAB users

This repo contains the material for a workshop that is being held in the Institute for Systems Neuroscience of the University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Germany in May 2022.

The notebooks are written in a way that allows for self-study. If you do want to follow along on your own, just clone the repository and go through the notebooks one by one.

If you don't know yet how to open jupyter notebooks, Github should render them for you. Alternatively, you can use the notebook viewer: https://nbviewer.org/github/LukasNeugebauer/Python_Workshop/tree/master/notebooks/
