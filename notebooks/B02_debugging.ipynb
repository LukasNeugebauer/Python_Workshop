    "I don't expect there to be any time left during the workshop. But for the off-chance that I'm wrong or if you want to use the material later on, here's a quick intro. Most of my debugging is done using `print`-statements, so my house also looks like this:\n",

    "This guys works as a data scientist for Google, so I'd say `print`statements are fine. Besides print-statements, the easiest way to debug your code is to read error messages and stop the code where errors happen to check the state of variables and find out what's causing the problems. \n",

    "In MATLAB you're doing this with the `keyboard` command or breakpoints in the GUI. Many IDEs provide you with a similar functionality (e.g. Spyder, VS Code, etc). In notebooks or if you're using another IDE that doesn't have that option, you can use the `ipdb` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ipdb` is short for **IP**ython **d**e**b**ugging. We will only have a look at one function and that's the only one I've ever used for debugging (other than `print` obviously). You probably have `ipdb` already installed, but if not you can use conda for this. The function is called `set_trace`. It works exactly the same way as `keyboard` works in MATLAB - stop execution of code and give control back for debugging. Let's import it:"
