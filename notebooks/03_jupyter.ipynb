This can then be saved as *HTML* or *PDF* documents. You can even transform them into [slides for a presentation](https://medium.com/learning-machine-learning/present-your-data-science-projects-with-jupyter-slides-75f20735eb0f).  It's also an obvious tool for [open notebook science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science).
