    "A module is every file that ends with `.py` and contains function definitions, constants and class definitions. It can also be run like you know it from an **.m** file. You can write modules yourself, and you should. In fact you just did by writing the `read_data` function in a `.py` file. One huge advantage is to avoid spaghetti code. Define your classes and functions in one file, import them in another or run them in the same file. Use different files to group related functions into modules. This way you bring a structure to your code. This improves readability, it leverages the pillars of OOP (abstraction) and it makes different parts of your code reusable for different aspects. No more copy-pasting code from one file to another. Just import it.\n",

    "   2. Rename it to **my_first_module.py**.\n",
    "   3. In this file, define two functions:\n",
    "      1. One that prints a message of your choice.\n",
    "      2. One that does any mathematical operation with its input, e.g. square, double, subtract 1, etc.\n",
    "   4. Save the file\n",

    "There are advantages and disadvantages to this approach. They will become apparent, when we import from more complicated modules and packages.

I.e. because you call `module.function()` and not just `function()`, you can have functions of the same name in different modules without a problem.\n",

Generally it's discouraged because 1) you typically don't need all the functions, 2) it's implicit, i.e. it's not clear from the code which function comes from which module and 3) it can lead to conflicts between functions of the same name that you didn't know about.
