    "\n",
    "A module is every file that ends with **.py**. It can contain function definitions, constants and class definitions. It can also be run like you know it from a **.m** file. You can write modules yourself, and you should. One huge advantage is to avoid spaghetti code. Define your classes and functions in one file, import them im another and this way you bring a structure to your code. This improves readability, it leverages the pillars of OOP (abstraction) and it makes different parts of your code reusable for different aspects. No more copy-pasting code from one file to another. Just import it.\n",

    "   3. In this file, define two functions:\n",
    "      1. One that prints a message of your choice.\n",
    "      2. One that does any mathematical operation with its input, e.g. square, double, subtract 1, etc.\n",

    "There are advantages and disadvantages to this approach. They will become apparent, when we import from more complicated modules and packages.
