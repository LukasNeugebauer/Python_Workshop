    "## 2.1 What do I need conda for?\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to MATLAB, you will need to manage packages in Python, i.e. download, install and update them, sometimes compile code, set path variables, etc.. Most packages depend on other packages. E.g. if you use a packages that somehow handles numerical data it will most likely depend on numpy. You need to also install numpy for this. **conda** and **pip** are **package managers**. They will do the package managing part for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 conda vs. pip\n",
    "\n",
    "Excluding the environment part, **conda** and **pip** pretty much do the same thing on the surface. **pip** is the original Python package manager. It was designed to be used for packages from **PyPi** - the Python Package Index. **conda** installs packages from the **Anaconda reposity**. They both look for packages in the respective repositories, install them and check that you have all dependencies installed. If not, they will install them for you. Most packages you will use can be installed using **conda**, but for some you will have to use **pip**. For the most part, you won't run into problems when installing some packages using **conda** and some using **pip**. Sometimes there are differences between the **pip** and the **conda** version, e.g. for *tensorflow*, see [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/stop-installing-tensorflow-using-pip-for-performance-sake-5854f9d9eb0c).\n",
    "There is a lot more to it, and if you are interested, you can find a short comparison of **conda** and **pip** [here](https://www.anaconda.com/understanding-conda-and-pip/). \n",
    "\n",
    "**conda** does more than just install packages. It can (and absolutely should) be used to manage environments. We'll figure out what that is in a second. **pip** itself doesn't manage environments, but it interfaces very well with **pipenv** and **virtualenv**, which do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, there is a lot to be understood here, but to get you going, it's not necessary. I use the following approach and I suggest you do the same:\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manage environments with conda. Install packages using conda whenever possible and use pip if that's not possible.**"

    "## 2.3 How do I use conda and pip?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two options for conda,\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the **Anaconda Navigator**, that you should have installed if you installed Anaconda. It's a GUI that's meant for people who are afraid of a command line interface. As usual, this probably has less steep of a learning curve but is less flexible. If you want to use it in the future, feel free. You can also use it for the workshop but then you have to figure out how to do that by yourself. I never used it. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/anaconda_navigator.PNG\" width=70% />\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "The second option is to use a shell. Technically we could use any shell that your operating system provides. But if you try to use conda in the Windows shell, you will likely find something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/shell_no_work.PNG\" width=70% />\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why: The shell has a PATH variable. I.e. a list of directories in which it's looking for programs that match the commands you give it. It's the same principle as the path variable in MATLAB. If you installed Anaconda using the suggested settings, the Windows shell PATH variable doesn't include Python and conda, so you can't use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/shell_no_path.PNG\" width=70% />\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workshop we'll use the **Anaconda prompt**. You can consider this the same as your standard OS shell except that the PATH and some settings are optimized to be used with conda, IPython and so on. You will need a few basic commands to navigate through directories in the shell. These are different in Windows and UNIX. You only really need `cd` and `dir`, but you can find a list [here](https://www.computerhope.com/overview.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're on Windows, hit the Windows key, type `Anaconda prompt` and hopefully you should see the icon. If you're on Linux or MaxOs you should be able to use the *Terminal*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open it up, it should look something like this. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/anaconda_prompt.PNG\" width=70% />\n",

So for now, we'll use the version that was included in the download and ignore warnings that tell us to update conda."

    "## 2.4 Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.1 What is dependency hell?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following: You install a package that is supposed to analyze SCR data. It uses a function that is new in **numpy 3.1** (arbitrary number). Afterwards you install a package that parses eyetracking files. It has a dependency on **numpy 3.0**. If you install this package, **conda** might downgrade **numpy** to 3.0 and the SCR package stops working. Plus of course dependencies themselves depend on other packages and if you install enough different things, sooner or later something will not be compatible. Welcome to dependency hell.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is too technical, let's try it this way. Going back to the idea of the Python interpreter actually being an interpreter: For some tasks it's not enough that an interpreter only speaks Japanese. He might also need technical knowledge to be able to translate. So we teach it to him, which is the equivalent to installing a package. If we use the same interpreter to translate in all areas, at some point he gets confused. It's better to have dedicated experts than to try to force someone to balance quantum mechanics and social skills. Maybe they're incompatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.2 Avoiding dependency hell using environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, there's two routes you can take:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. You don't bother using environments. For quite a while everything works out. You think back to the workshop and laugh about me because I overcomplicate things. At some points, everything stops working and since you only have one environment you don't have a clean one to go back to. You have no clue where the problem is, StackOverflow is not helping you either. You try for a bit but eventually give up, reinstall Anaconda completely and the first thing you do is creating an environment. And creating a clone. And saving it to a .txt-file. You may now proceed to the second option. (This is the route I took and I can strongly advise against taking it.)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2. You're smart and use environments from the start. Whenever you install a new package that has a lot of dependencies, you clone your working environment, install the package in there. If everything works, you install the package in the environment you're using. You might consider that you're putting too much effort into this, but since you don't have any problems, it becomes a habit and you stick to it. Very well done!\n",
    "   \n",
    "Feel free to choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.3 Okay, I'm convinced. But what is an environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent question! The short and simple version (that is suprisingly close to the truth:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an environment one instance of the Python interpreter and a folder in which the packages are stored. They are completely isolated from each other. If you have a package in more than one environment (e.g. every environment will use numpy), you have multiple copies of this package. One per folder/environment. This is of course not parsimonious and not that elegant either. And it is the reason why some system administrators don't like Python on their servers. But it works. Also, it means that if you fuck up beyond repair in one folder, the other folders don't care. \n",
    "\n",
    "Activating an environment means telling the **Anaconda prompt** which version of Python to call. It also makes sure that when you start an instance of the Python interpreter e.g. via IPython or Jupyter, the interpreter knows in which folder to look for packages that you can import.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do this from the beginning. Remember - **you** are responsible for housekeeping. Take this seriously and try to stick to **conda** as much as possible. Using **pip** as needed is fine, but if you mix up too many things you might end up with something like this:\n",
