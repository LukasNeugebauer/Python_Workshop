    "# 7. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming ( OOP )\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.1 Programming paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are that until now you didn't have to think about programming paradigms. There are multiple reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. You only know one language (or similar languages) and developed an intuitive understanding of the underlying structure\n",
    "   2. Most languages are not \"pure\" in that they only support one programming paradigm. Some, e.g. Haskell, are. They're supposed to be awesome but not very popular.\n",
    "   3. Programming paradigms sometimes don't have clear borders between each other. I still don't really get the difference between imperative and procedural programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming paradigms can be understood as a philosophy of coding, an abstraction of how to think about problems. One important concept here is **state** which in MATLAB is roughly the values of variables in your workspace. Paradigms handle the state differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to learn a whole lot about programming paradigms if you switch from MATLAB to Python. I don't know a whole lot about it either (yet). I highly recommend this [blogpost](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2018/03/12/an-introduction-to-programming-paradigms/) that introduces imperative, functional and object-oriented programming by solving the same problem in three different ways in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an ultra-short explanation of paradigms. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Imperative/procedural programming** is often like an IKEA instruction or a recipe. First do step 1, then do step 2 where all of the steps change the state. Use function `screwdriver` to combine variable `screw` and variable `board` into the new variable `sideboard`. This is very convenient for coding but becomes unpredictable in larger programms. It's probably the style of programming you're most used to. The distinction is that imperative programming tells the computer what to do in statements, while procedural programming tells the computer what it wants done and doesn't care about how the computer does it. Don't worry too much about it if you don't really understand what that's supposed to mean. Neither do I. There's variables and there's functions that change the value of variables and that's all you need to know right now. I'll use *imperative programming* to refer to this style.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functional programming** tries to avoid changes in state, i.e. you can't change the value of variables or there are no variables and everything is functions. It's really hard to understand for people used to imperative or object-oriented programming - I have no clue how it works. This makes programming way harder but it makes programms more maintainable and predictable. It's considered *pure* programming by hardcore computer scientists. If you want to impress them, learn Haskell. You don't need to understand functional programming to use Python. But learning a bit about it will most likely make you a better programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object-oriented programming** gets rid of the dichotomy between state and ways to change it by *encapsulating* different aspects of the global state into objects. These objects also have methods to work on their own state. Imagine a dog that has attributes like the color and state of it's hair or it's level of hungryness. It also has methods like `eat()` or `scratch()` to change it's state. OOP tries to model the *real world* which brings a few new problems with it but is very intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.2 Programming paradigms in Python vs. MATLAB\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB is not a pure language. It's mostly imperative - or better: It's probably the style you have mostly been using in MATLAB. Technically you can use a more functional style. But this is implicitely discouraged because you can only define function in scripts and not everywhere. What some of you might know: You can also use OOP in MATLAB. Version 2008a introduced syntax for classes more similar to other OO languages than before. You might find it if you look into source code of Toolboxes like *SPM* but in my experience it's not very frequently used by end-users. I suspect one reason to be the horrible syntax, but maybe that's just me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is not pure either. How you use it is up to you. You can pretty much translate your MATLAB code line by line to Python and it would run. It wouldn't be very idiomatic though. The fact that everything - including functions and classes - are objects makes it easier to use functional and OOP features than in MATLAB. Also, even when you don't want to use classes yourself, you have to understand what they are if you want to understand why a list has methods or if you even consider using packages like `scikit-learn`. For this reason, we introduce OOP now, before you have time to be confused about something like:"

    "There are 4 pillars of OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Encapsulation\n",
    "   2. Inheritance\n",
    "   3. Abstraction\n",
    "   4. Polymorphism\n",
    "   \n",
    "Of course, this information doesn't help you in the slightest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The short version: OOP combines data (OOP: properties/attributes) and functions (OOP: methods) into objects. Objects are instances of a blueprint called \"class\". It's combining variables and functions into one (Encapsulation). These objects can change their state and have access to their own properties. They can be used without knowing the class definition (Abstraction). Classes can steal methods and properties from other classes and this way become increasingly complex (Inheritance). Different classes can do the same thing in a different way (Polymorphism).\n",

    "Still doesn't much more sense? Don't worry, it will soon.\n",

    "\n",
    "Inheritance literally means inheritance. Classes can \"inherit from other classes\" which means they have all the attributes of the class they inherited from. This can be used to create increasingly complex classes. E.g. all animals have an aerobic metabolism. So you could define the metabolism in a general class \"Animal\" and let every subclass like \"Dog\" inherit from that and add species specific attributes. Then you could have the classes \"Pitbull\" and \"Golden_retriever\" inherit from that one. You get the idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "In actual scientific applications (assuming data analysis, not writing data analysis tools where classes would be abundant) this can be used several ways:\n",
    "One way I use it is to define one basic class per project. In this project to define some things that are the same for all subjects and modalities like the path structure. You can also just write some info about the experiment in there. Then you could have classes for every modality like SCR, fMRI, behavioral data that inherit from this class. Increasingly complex you can combine modalities per subject in a class \"Subject\" and combine subjects in a class \"Group_level\".\n",

    "   2. A method called 'state_metabolism' that prints \"My metabolism is aerobic\". \n",
