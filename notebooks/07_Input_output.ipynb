    "## 7.1 Reading and writing files with open()\n",
    "\n",
    "If you read or wrote into a language-agnostic file before (e.g. while logging your experiment), you've probably seen or written something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "f = fopen(\"sub1.log\", \"w\");\n",
    "fprintf(f, \"reaction took %f seconds\\n\", rt);\n",
    "fclose(f);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What you're doing here is opening up the file with the specified permission. In the case above, we opened the file with writing permission (`\"w\"`). You can also use read permission (`\"r\"`), append permission (`\"a\"`, which unline `w` doesn't overwrite the previous content and multiple at once (e.g. `w+` or `r+` to both read and write). Closing the file is important to prevent corrupted files (i.e. something unexpected happens to the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to translate the part above directly into Python, it would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"sub1.log\", \"w\")\n",
    "f.write(f\"reaction took {rt} seconds\\n\")\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So you see the principle is the same, but notice the differences:\n",
    " * `open` instead of `fopen`\n",
    " * `.write` and `.close` are methods of the object which represents the stream into the file.\n",
    " \n",
    "One nifty trick to prevent having to close the file again is to use a `context manager`. Those are more fit for a late intermediate course than a beginner's course, but the bottom line in the context of opening a file is, that it gets closed for you once you leave the code block:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"sub1.log\", \"w\") as f:\n",
    "    f.write(f\"reaction took {rt} seconds\\n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the permission, the text stream object provides you with a few functions to read from or write to the file:\n",
    "\n",
    " * in read mode\n",
    "    * `.read()`\n",
    "    * `.readlines()`\n",
