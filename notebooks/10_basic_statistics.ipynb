I.e. we first create a linear regression object with the data to fit and then fit it in a second step. So the procedure works like that:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Import the correct module from the statsmodels package. This one uses numpy arrays. There is another module which is meant to be used with named arrays (such as `pandas` data frames). That way you can use equations to specify the model like you might know it from `R`.\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import statsmodels.api as sm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Then you create a regression object. In this step you already specify the dependent variable and the design matrix (i.e. the independent variables). If you want to fit an intercept and your design matrix does not contain a column of ones, you can add one with `statsmodels`. Although of course you already know how to do that with only `numpy`.\n",

    "```python\n",

    "X = sm.add_constant(X)\n",
    "lin_reg = sm.OLS(y, X) # dependent variable comes first!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Now you can use the linear regression object to fit the model. This will return a detailed fit object.\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "fit = lin_reg.fit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. This fit object provides you with methods that report the model fit. E.g. the `fit.summary()` method:\n",

    "fit.summary()\n",
    "```\n",
