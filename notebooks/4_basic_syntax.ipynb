In Python, most functions are either in a package that you need to manually import or they are methods of classes. We'll get to know this in the part about object oriented programming.\n",

    "Indexing in Python starts at 0. Indexing with slices `[from_index:to_index]` doesn't include the to_index. This is one of the few things that you'll need a while to get used to. My experience is that you can switch back and forth between 1- and 0-based indexing on the fly if you got used to both once. \n",

    "Arguably 0-based indexing is more in line with what happens in your computer's memory and it can help avoid [off-by-one errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error). But as usual everyone is very dogmatic about it and convinced that they're right. Just treat it as an arbitraty choice that you get used to. If you want to learn Python, there's no way around it."
