This can then be saved as *HTML* or *PDF* documents. It's also an obvious tool for [open notebook science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science). This way you can present results while making them directly reproducible and on top communicating your thought process and justification for your analysis strategies. **Jupyter notebooks** themselves are language agnostic.
