    "## 5.1 Programming paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are that until now you didn't have to think about programming paradigms. There are multiple reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. You only know one language (or similar languages) and developed an intuitive understanding of the underlying structure.\n",
    "   2. Most languages are not \"pure\" in that they only support one programming paradigm.\n",
    "   3. Programming paradigms overlap sometimes. I still don't really get the difference between imperative and procedural programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming paradigms can be understood as an abstraction of how to think about problems. One important concept here is **state** which in MATLAB is roughly the values of variables in your workspace. Paradigms handle the state differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to learn a whole lot about programming paradigms if you switch from MATLAB to Python. I highly recommend this [blogpost](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2018/03/12/an-introduction-to-programming-paradigms/) that introduces imperative, functional and object-oriented programming by solving the same problem in three different ways in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an ultra-short explanation of paradigms. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Imperative/procedural programming** is often like an IKEA instruction or a recipe. First do step 1, then do step 2 where all of the steps change the state. Use function `screwdriver` to combine variable `screw` and variable `board` into the new variable `sideboard`. It's probably the style of programming you're most used to. The distinction is that imperative programming tells the computer what to do in statements, while procedural programming tells the computer what it wants done and doesn't care about how the computer does it. There's variables and there's functions that change the value of variables and that's all you need to know right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functional programming** tries to avoid changes in state, i.e. you can't change the value of variables or there are no variables and everything is functions. It's really hard to understand for people used to imperative or object-oriented programming - I have no clue how it works. You don't need to understand functional programming to use Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object-oriented programming** gets rid of the dichotomy between state and ways to change it by *encapsulating* different aspects of the global state into objects. These objects also have methods to work on their own state. Imagine a dog that has attributes like the color and state of it's hair or it's level of satiety. It also has methods like `eat()` or `scratch()` to change its state. OOP tries to model the *real world* which brings a few new problems with it but is very intuitive."

    "## 5.2 Programming paradigms in Python vs. MATLAB\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB is not a pure language. It's mostly imperative - or better: That's probably the style you have mostly been using in MATLAB. What some of you might know: You can also use OOP in MATLAB. Version 2008a introduced syntax for classes more similar to other OO languages than before. You might find it if you look into source code of Toolboxes like *SPM* but in my experience it's not very frequently used by end-users. I suspect one reason to be the horrible syntax, but maybe that's just me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is not pure either. How you use it is up to you. You can pretty much translate your MATLAB code line by line to Python and it would run. It wouldn't be very idiomatic though. Python has a stronger OOP aspect than MATLAB. Even when you don't want to write classes yourself, your ability to use Python will be fairly limited if you don't understand the basics of object-oriented programming. So here we go:"

    "## 5.3 Object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 pillars of OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Encapsulation\n",
    "   2. Inheritance\n",
    "   3. Abstraction\n",
    "   4. Polymorphism\n",
    "   \n",
    "Of course, this information doesn't help you in the slightest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The short version: OOP combines data (OOP: properties/attributes) and functions (OOP: methods) into objects. Objects are instances of a blueprint called \"class\". They combine variables and functions (Encapsulation). These objects can change their state and have access to their own properties. They can be used without knowing the class definition (Abstraction). Classes can steal methods and properties from other classes and this way become increasingly complex (Inheritance). Different classes can do the same thing in a different way (Polymorphism).\n",
    "\n",
    "Still doesn't much more sense? Don't worry, it will soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it look like in praxis? \n",
    "\n",
    "Imperative: There is a variable and a function that works on the variable.\n",
    "```\n",
    "array = [1, 2, 3];\n",
    "m = mean(array)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP: There is an object that contains both data and the method to work on this data.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MeanList:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, data):\n",
    "        self.data = data\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def mean(self):\n",
    "        return sum(self.data) / len(self.data)\n",
    "        \n",
    "array = MeanList([1, 5, 4, 6])\n",
    "m = array.mean()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes vs. objects\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. There has to be a class definition before you can have an instance of it. Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. You are an instance of the class \"human\"\n",
    "   2. Python is an instance of the class \"programming language\" \n",
    "   3. Your dog is an instance of the class \"dog\". It's also an instance of the more abstract class \"animal\". So are you btw.\n",
    "   \n",
    "One word on conventions: Class definitions use camel case notation, i.e. the first letter is capitalized, and where you would use an underscore in function or variable names, you add another capital letter. If you would have a function vs. a class for linear regression, it would look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def linear_regression(X, y):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "class LinearRegression:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is not enforced, but it's useful because you can tell what you're dealing with from the code. Also a consistent style is one of the easiest things you can do to make your code look tidy and professional. Other than that don't worry about the code for now. Understand the concepts."

    "\n",
    "Inheritance literally means inheritance. Classes can \"inherit from other classes\" which means they have all the attributes of the class they inherited from. This can be used to create increasingly complex classes. E.g. all animals have an aerobic metabolism. So you could define the metabolism in a general class \"Animal\" and let every subclass like \"Dog\" inherit from that and add species specific attributes. Then you could have the classes \"Pitbull\" and \"GoldenRetriever\" inherit from that one. You get the idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "In actual scientific applications (assuming data analysis, not writing data analysis tools where classes would be abundant) this can be used in several ways:\n",
    "For example, to avoid hardcoding of paths and constants in different places, you could put them in a project class for your study and the classes for data preparation and analysis inherit from that class. If someone wants to run all of your code, they only need to change the hardcoded stuff in one place.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "   1. A class attribute called 'metabolism' with value 'aerobic'.\n",
    "   2. A method called 'state_metabolism' that prints \"My metabolism is aerobic\". \n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need an `__init__()`method for that because this is a fixed attribute. It's the same for all instances. For the second part you can use the attribute `self.metabolism` and string concatenation if you already figured out how it works. If not, don't worry. Just writing the sentence is fine! "
