    "\n",
    "There is no way to turn you into proficient Python users in just 2 1/2 days. But if this goes according to plan, you have a good starting point and we're past the initial \"where do I even start\" phase. You should be able to keep on going from there on. For this reason we can't really cover anything in depth, but we'll scratch the surface on many things to provide you with a starting point to dig deeper. The whole workshop goes from broad to more specific. In the beginning we'll talk about interpreted programming languages, package management and so on. Then we'll cover base python before we dig deeper into the scientific python stack. I had to make a choice here, because unline MATLAB there's a lot of possible packages to cover. Fundamentally you could either do the `pandas` + `seaborn` version or the `numpy` + `matplotlib` one, which would give you a more R- or MATLAB-like experience, respectively. I decided for the second version for two major reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) While R users are welcome and will be able to follow the course just fine, this workshop is aimed at MATLAB users, so I tried to make the transition as painless as possible.\n",
    "2) numpy and matplotlib are the more fundamental packages. Pandas and seaboarn are based on them and while you need to know some numpy to use pandas, the opposite is not true.\n",
    "3) Adding to the second point, I'm convinced that learning the fundamentals before going into the highest level of abstraction will make you a more proficient user. There's tons of \"why does my CNN in tensorflow not run\" type questions on stackoverflow, where the solution is to understand how a basic function works in python. I do not intend to add to that.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're currently enrolled in the second iteration of this workshop. And while I was quite happy with it (and the feedback was very positive), I've made a few changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) I kicked out a few things and shortened a some others. There was nothing wrong with them, but they were not essential and kept me from covering more important stuff as well as spending more time on numpy due to time constraints.\n",
    "2) There is no longer an isolated project that you're supposed to be doing on your own in the end. To make this less daunting and assure that we at least manage to write parts of it, we'll add functionality on the way starting with I/O, where you'll write a function to load the data."

    "Your computer understands neither MATLAB nor Python. If you want to directly give instructions to the computer you need to talk machine language - which probably you don't. So wether it's C, MATLAB or Python, someone has to talk to the computer for you. There are two ways to do this:\n",
    " 1. You can compile the whole program, which means translating it to machine code. This means faster runtime and the chance to catch errors at compile time. It also means more complicated syntax.\n",
    " 2. You can interpret the program while running it and mapping it onto precompiled routines. This is slower and often you just find bugs at runtime.\n",
    " \n",
    "After compilation the program is machine code (e.g. an .exe-file on Windows) that contains instructions for the CPU and runs on its own. You can compare it to a ralley driver that knows every curve of the route before driving. Interpreted languages are more like navigating in a new city and only noticing you're in a dead end when it's too late. There are advantages and disadvantages. We don't go into detail here, but the major drawback with interpreted languages is speed. If speed is a bottleneck, there are multiple ways to speed up Python including PyPy, numba and Cython.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a very crude but somewhat functional mental model of what an interpreter does, let's think about a human interpreter. E.g. you need to communicate with someone that only speaks Janapese. That's hard to learn for you but learning English is not that hard. So you learn English and talk to an interpreter that translates to Japanese and back to English. It's similar here. Machine language is very hard to learn but Python really isn't. So you learn Python and talk in Python to the interpreter and the interpreter translates to machine language and back."

It's originally not meant to be used for scientific computing. This is only possible through packages that supply Python with e.g. MATLAB-like matrices (_numpy_), R-like DataFrames (_pandas_), linear algebra (_numpy_, _scipy_) and plotting libraries (_matplotlib_ and _seaborn_). These often rely on C for speed. So it's a general purpose programming language with scientific computing glued on top.

If you want to learn more about this principle, you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSmOry4PY0Q) in which someone writes an interactive Python interpreter in Python in less than 30 minutes.
