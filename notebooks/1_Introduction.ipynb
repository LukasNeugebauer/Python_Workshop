    "Your computer understands neither MATLAB nor Python. If you want to directly give instructions to the computer you need to talk machine language - which probably you don't. So wether it's C, MATLAB or Python, someone has to talk to the computer for you. This can either be a **compiler** or an **interpreter**. Compilation makes sure that everything works before you actually run a program and translates the code to machine language. After compilation the program is machine code and can for example be an .exe-file that runs on its own. You can compare it to a ralley driver that knows every curve of the route before driving. Interpreted languages are more like navigating in a new city and only noticing you're in a dead end when it's too late. There are advantages and disadvantages. We don't go into detail here, but the major drawback with interpreted languages is speed. If speed is a bottleneck, there are ways to speed up Python including PyPy, which is a just-in-time-compiler."
