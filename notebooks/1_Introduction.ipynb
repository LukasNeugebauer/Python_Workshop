    "Your computer understands neither MATLAB nor Python. If you want to directly give instructions to the computer you need to talk machine language - which probably you don't. So wether it's C, MATLAB or Python, someone has to talk to the computer for you. There are two ways to do this:\n",
    " 1. You can compile the whole program, which means translating it to machine code. This means faster runtime and the chance to catch errors at compile time. It also means more complicated syntax.\n",
    " 2. You can interpret the program while running it and mapping it onto precompiled routines. This is slower and often you just find bugs at runtime.\n",
    " \n",
    "After compilation the program is machine code (e.g. an .exe-file on Windows) that contains instructions for the CPU and runs on its own. You can compare it to a ralley driver that knows every curve of the route before driving. Interpreted languages are more like navigating in a new city and only noticing you're in a dead end when it's too late. There are advantages and disadvantages. We don't go into detail here, but the major drawback with interpreted languages is speed. If speed is a bottleneck, there are multiple ways to speed up Python including PyPy, numba and Cython.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a very crude but somewhat functional mental model of what an interpreter does, let's think about a human interpreter. E.g. you need to communicate with someone that only speaks Janapese. That's hard to learn for you but learning English is not that hard. So you learn English and talk to an interpreter that translates to Japanese and back to English. It's similar here. Machine language is very hard to learn but Python really isn't. So you learn Python and talk in Python to the interpreter and the interpreter translates to machine language and back."

It still is although nowadays it's different FORTRAN algebra libraries. Everything else, non-matrix data types and support for object-oriented programming (OOP) where patched to it later.

But it gets a bit bumpy once you leave that road.\n",

It's originally not meant to be used for scientific computing. This is only possible through packages that supply Python with e.g. MATLAB-like matrices (_numpy_), R-like DataFrames (_pandas_), linear algebra (_numpy_, _scipy_) and plotting libraries (_matplotlib_ and _seaborn_). These often rely on C for speed. So it's a general purpose programming language with scientific computing glued on top.

You might also know this behavior from shells like *bash*/*zsh* (Unix) or *cmd* (Windows). The MATLAB command window is not that different, except that you use a different language. If you want to learn more about this principle, you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSmOry4PY0Q) in which someone writes an interactive Python interpreter in Python in less than 30 minutes.
