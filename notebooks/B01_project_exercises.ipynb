    "# Project Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "During the workshop we will interrupt the input and use some of our new-found knowledge in a small project. The data for this project is taken from the following study. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The general idea behind the exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general comment on the following exercises: I strongly believe in figuring stuff out by yourself as a learning tool, which means good exercises should now purely repeat stuff that we already did 1:1. This is especially true in programming where figuring out how stuff works using the documentation, google or stackoverflow is part of the deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, I tried to design the project assignments in a way that are largely -but now completely- solvable using the stuff we covered so far. That means if you read the exercise and feel like \"I don't know how to do that\", don't worry - that's by design! Feel free to use the internet!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I am aware of the heterogeneity in tech-savyness and preexisting programming knowledge. So for the assignments during the online workshop, we will now split the group into two parts: \n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Those who feel comfortable taking the challenge on on their own go to the breakout room. \n",
    " 2. Those who prefer a more guided approach or are uncertain whether they manage the assignment on their own can stay here. We will work out a solution together. \n",
    " \n",
    "Both options are absolutely fine, so don't feel pressured! You can also change your mind midway and change the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a total of 6 Exercises that should familiarize you with some basics in the scientific python stack:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Read the data\n",
    " 2. Split the data set\n",
    " 3. Descriptive statistics in numpy\n",
    " 4. Mean comparison in scipy\n",
    " 5. Linear regression in statsmodels\n",
    " 6. Plot the results in matplotlib\n",
    " \n",
    "You can complete the assignments in this notebook or move to a `.py` file for that. It's up to you.\n",
    " \n",
    "The schedule for the workshop is **packed**. So if we manage to actually complete all these exercises, that's absolutely amazing. If not, that's no problem. I'll provide an example solution and you can try it yourself later on. You've still learnt a lot of Python in just 2.5 days."

    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project is taken from the following study. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Kerry, N., & Murray, D. R. (2021). Physical Strength Partly Explains Sex Differences in Trait Anxiety in Young Americans. Psychological Science, 32(5), 809â€“815. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797620971298](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620971298)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the files in the `data` folder. Originally it was a `.sav`, i.e. SPSS file. I took the liberty to select a few columns and produce a `.tsv` file that we can read into python more easily. The topic of the study is not really important. I chose this study because it provides a nice simple data set that we can use to implement some of the scientific python that we cover in the notebooks. It was suprisingly hard to find a data set that was a) not too complicated and b) where the data was shared in a way that is actually usable. (Having looked at quite a few OSF repos until I found this one, I think *Psychological Science* should be more picky with handing out badges for open data and open code. If your spaghetti code is not documented and your data is pretty much unusable because there is no README that tells users which file contains which data, you might as well not share code and data. But that's besides the point.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, to give you a rough idea about the study: The variables that we will look at are\n",
    "\n",
    " * `Grip`: A measure of grip strength\n",
    " * `Anxiety`: A questionnaire-based estimate of trait anxiety\n",
    " * `Sex`: Biological Sex, coded as 0=male and 1=female\n",
    " \n",
    "This kind of tabular data could be very well handled with `pandas`. In practice I would probably use that to be honest, but since we stick to the design principles and you should know `numpy`, we'll use that instead."

    "## 1: Read the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is of course to load the data into python. Write a function that reads the `.csv`-file in the data folder. The data consists of multiple variables. The variable names are in the first row. Your function should follow this structure:\n",

If you go for the vanilla python one, you will need `str.split` and `str.strip` methods of strings and either the `int` or `float` class. If you're using `numpy`, you will have to read the column names separately.\n",
